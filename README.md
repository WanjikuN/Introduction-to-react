# Introduction to React

React is an open-source JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture. It offers a streamlined approach to rendering complex user interfaces efficiently.

At the core of React is the concept of components. The rendering process starts with a single root component, which serves as the foundation for the entire application.

This project highlights the following aspects:
- Using React as a powerful JavaScript library for UI development.
- Creating a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.
- Building a web application using native DOM manipulations.
- Transitioning from native DOM calls to React without JSX.
- Adapting React code to leverage JSX for enhanced readability.

## Toolchain
- Next.js
> Ensure that Node.js is installed by checking its version with `node -v`. If not, you can install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version using `nvm install --lts`.

1. Create a Next.js web application:
`npx create-next-app@latest <name>`
1. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd <name>`
1. Start the development server:
`npm run dev`
1. View your app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or the available port.

This project showcases the progression from traditional DOM manipulation to the powerful component-based approach provided by React.
